# hello-world
Initial Github Setup

Hiya I'm Hunter, and this is the start of my github account. I like anime, disk golf, shooting guns, and just generally hanging out with my buddies. I'm an aerospace engineering major at TAMU, and work for mechanical engineering. 

Peace 


This is my secondary attempt, solo this time. 


Alrihty, I've gotten the hang of this. Attmpt #3.
